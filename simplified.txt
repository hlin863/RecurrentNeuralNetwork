In this scene, there was a council meeting organised by Tywin Lannister. In the scene, Tywin was there to attend all the members, waiting at the head of the table, and there were 5 chairs placed at his right. And then comes Little finger, Varys, and Grand Master, Tyrion Lannister and Cersei. And then Little finger, Varys and Grand Master hurries to sit as close as Tywin as possible. It shows they want to be near power as much as possible. Then, Cersei patiently takes a chair and put it at the immediate left of Tywin( showing an unorthodox approach to power).

And then came Tyrion Lannister taking at a chair and putting it the at the opposite of Tywin, still manages to capture everyone's attention through his intelligence.

It shows that in your pursuit of power, it doesn't matter much where you are and what you have but how capable you are.
